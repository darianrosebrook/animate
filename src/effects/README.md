# Effects System Architecture

## Overview

The Animator Effects System provides a comprehensive, GPU-accelerated effects pipeline designed for professional motion graphics workflows. Built on WebGPU/WGSL with deterministic rendering guarantees, this system delivers real-time performance while maintaining pixel-perfect output across all platforms.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Deterministic Rendering
- **Pixel-perfect consistency** across GPU vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon)
- **Seeded randomness** for reproducible effects
- **Fixed precision policy** with configurable floating-point precision
- **Golden frame validation** with perceptual difference scoring

### 2. Real-time Performance
- **60fps timeline interaction** with complex effect chains
- **Sub-16ms parameter updates** for responsive user feedback
- **GPU memory pooling** with automatic defragmentation
- **Shader precompilation** for instant effect application

### 3. Professional Quality Standards
- **Broadcast compliance** (EBU R128, ATSC A/85)
- **Color accuracy** (ΔE < 1.0 across color spaces)
- **Accessibility support** (reduced motion preferences)
- **Professional format support** (ProRes, DNxHD, EXR sequences)
