  modules: ["renderer", "scene-graph", "effects", "timeline", "preview", "library"]
  data_migration: false
operational_rollback_slo: "30m"
threats:
  - "Color accuracy drift across different GPU vendors and color spaces"
  - "Performance regression in real-time color transformations during timeline scrubbing"
  - "Inconsistent color behavior between preview and export rendering"
  - "Memory leaks in GPU color processing pipelines"
  - "Accessibility compliance violations in color contrast and reduced motion"
scope:
  in: ["color space management", "gamma correction", "color transformation pipelines", "library color tokens", "real-time color preview", "golden-frame color validation", "color accessibility compliance"]
  out: ["advanced HDR color spaces", "3D LUT color grading", "color-managed printing pipeline"]
invariants:
  - "Color transformations maintain deterministic output across all supported GPUs and platforms"
  - "Real-time color parameter changes reflect immediately in timeline preview (≤16ms response)"
  - "Color system preserves alpha channel and layer blending modes during transformations"
  - "Performance impact ≤5% on existing compositions with color effects"
  - "Color accuracy maintains ΔE < 1.0 between preview and export rendering"
  - "All color transformations support reduced motion preferences"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "composition with 50+ layers including text, shapes, and media with color effects"
    when: "apply color transformation with gamma=2.2, color space=sRGB"
    then: "color renders correctly in real-time preview; exported ProRes matches preview within ΔE < 1.0"
  - id: A2
    given: "color transformation applied to layer with alpha transparency"
    when: "scrub timeline at 60fps with real-time color parameter changes"
    then: "smooth playback without frame drops; alpha compositing preserved; color accuracy maintained"
  - id: A3
    given: "library color token applied to multiple layers across different scenes"
    when: "update color token value in library"
    then: "all instances update immediately; preview matches golden frame reference; export maintains consistency"
  - id: A4
    given: "color system with accessibility requirements"
    when: "toggle reduced motion preferences or high contrast mode"
    then: "color transformations respect accessibility settings; contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
