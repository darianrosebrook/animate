threats:
  - "Complex GPU shaders may impact performance on lower-end hardware"
  - "Effect composition may introduce visual artifacts or color inaccuracies"
  - "Timeline integration could cause frame drops during effect animation"
  - "Large effect libraries may cause memory pressure"
scope:
  in: ["effects architecture", "GPU shader framework", "effect composition", "timeline integration", "glow/blur/color effects", "effect parameters", "performance optimization"]
  out: ["particle systems", "advanced distortion effects", "LUT color grading", "3D effects", "video effects"]
invariants:
  - "Effects maintain 60fps performance during real-time playback"
  - "Effect composition preserves color accuracy and visual consistency"
  - "Effect parameters provide immediate visual feedback during adjustment"
  - "GPU memory usage optimized for complex effect stacks"
  - "Effects work correctly across different GPU architectures and drivers"
acceptance:
  - id: E1
    given: "user applies glow effect to a layer with intensity=0.8, radius=20"
    when:  "user scrubs timeline at 60fps"
    then:  "glow effect renders smoothly without frame drops; exported ProRes matches preview"
  - id: E2
    given: "user stacks multiple effects (blur + color correction + glow)"
    when:  "user adjusts effect parameters in real-time"
    then:  "effects compose correctly with proper blend modes; performance remains above 50fps"
  - id: E3
    given: "user animates effect parameters over time using keyframes"
    when:  "user plays back complex animation with 20+ effect keyframes"
    then:  "effect animation plays smoothly with accurate timing; memory usage stable"
  - id: E4
    given: "user works with effect library containing 50+ professional effects"
    when:  "user applies effects to multiple layers simultaneously"
    then:  "effects load quickly; GPU memory usage optimized; no memory leaks"
