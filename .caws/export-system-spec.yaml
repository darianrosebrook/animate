  modules: ["renderer", "encoder", "render-farm", "format-handlers", "quality-validation"]
  data_migration: false
operational_rollback_slo: "15m"
threats:
  - "Render quality degradation during format conversion"
  - "Performance bottlenecks in batch processing"
  - "Codec compatibility issues across platforms"
  - "Memory exhaustion during large export operations"
scope:
  in: ["video export system", "professional codecs", "web formats", "render farm", "quality validation", "batch processing", "format conversion", "export queue"]
  out: ["real-time streaming", "advanced color grading", "3D export formats", "enterprise asset management"]
invariants:
  - "Export quality matches preview rendering within Î”E < 1.0 and SSIM > 0.98"
  - "All exports maintain deterministic output regardless of export worker"
  - "Export operations are resumable and restartable from any checkpoint"
  - "Memory usage scales linearly with export complexity, not exponentially"
  - "Codec-specific optimizations preserve visual quality within professional tolerances"
  - "Export queue maintains FIFO order with priority override capability"
  - "Background processing never impacts interactive performance"
  - "Format validation ensures exported files meet specification requirements"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "complex composition with 50+ layers, effects, and 3D elements"
    when:  "export to ProRes 422 at 1080p 30fps"
    then:  "completes in < 2 minutes with quality matching preview (SSIM > 0.98)"
  - id: A2
    given: "animation with custom easing curves and particle effects"
    when:  "export to Lottie format for web delivery"
    then:  "produces valid Lottie file with animations preserved and optimized size"
  - id: A3
    given: "workspace with 100+ compositions requiring batch export"
    when:  "queue all compositions for background rendering"
    then:  "processes queue efficiently with progress tracking and resumable jobs"
  - id: A4
    given: "export worker failure during large render job"
    when:  "system detects failure and retries"
    then:  "automatically resumes from last checkpoint without quality loss"
  - id: A5
    given: "export to multiple formats simultaneously"
    when:  "user requests ProRes, H.264, and Lottie exports"
    then:  "processes all formats in parallel without blocking UI interaction"
