threats:
  - "Performance degradation during complex timeline scrubbing"
  - "Keyframe editing may cause visual glitches during playback"
  - "Curve manipulation could introduce timing inconsistencies"
  - "Large timelines may cause memory pressure"
scope:
  in: ["timeline data model", "keyframe editing", "curve manipulation", "playback engine", "timeline UI", "animation preview"]
  out: ["audio synchronization", "advanced easing functions", "motion graphics effects", "3D animation support"]
invariants:
  - "Timeline operations maintain frame-accurate timing precision"
  - "Keyframe placement provides immediate visual feedback"
  - "Curve editing maintains smooth, predictable animation results"
  - "Playback maintains 60fps performance for typical scenes"
  - "Timeline handles complex animations with multiple tracks smoothly"
acceptance:
  - id: T1
    given: "user creates a new animation project with multiple layers"
    when:  "user adds keyframes to position, rotation, and scale properties"
    then:  "keyframes are placed accurately and animation curves are generated automatically"
  - id: T2
    given: "user opens the curve editor for a property track"
    when:  "user manipulates bezier handles to adjust animation timing"
    then:  "animation updates in real-time with smooth curve interpolation"
  - id: T3
    given: "user scrubs the timeline with complex animations"
    when:  "user drags the playhead through the timeline"
    then:  "animation plays back smoothly with accurate frame timing"
  - id: T4
    given: "user works with a timeline containing 50+ keyframes across multiple tracks"
    when:  "user performs bulk keyframe operations"
    then:  "operations complete within 100ms and maintain timeline integrity"
