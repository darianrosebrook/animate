title: "Workspace Management - Hierarchical Project Organization System"
risk_tier: 2
mode: feature
change_budget:
  max_files: 50
  max_loc: 2500
blast_radius:
  modules: ["workspace-system", "collaboration", "metadata", "search", "permissions"]
  data_migration: false
operational_rollback_slo: "30m"
threats:
  - "Performance degradation with large workspaces (>1000 files)"
  - "Complex permission model leading to user confusion"
  - "Data consistency issues during concurrent operations"
  - "Search relevance degradation at scale"
scope:
  in: ["workspace management", "project organization", "file hierarchy", "metadata system", "collaboration permissions", "search and discovery", "CRUD operations", "bulk file operations"]
  out: ["real-time file locking", "advanced version control", "offline-first sync", "binary diffing"]
invariants:
  - "Hierarchical integrity: Files must belong to projects, projects must belong to workspaces"
  - "Metadata consistency: All metadata follows strict typing and validation rules"
  - "Permission inheritance: Child entities inherit parent permissions unless explicitly overridden"
  - "Deterministic IDs: All entities have stable, globally unique identifiers"
  - "Audit trail: All operations are logged with user, timestamp, and context"
  - "Conflict resolution: Concurrent edits resolved via operational transformation"
  - "Version safety: Operations maintain referential integrity across versions"
  - "Performance bounds: Navigation and search operations complete within specified time limits"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "user creates workspace 'Brand Projects'"
    when:  "creates project 'Holiday Campaign' within workspace"
    then:  "creates file 'hero.anim' within project and navigates using breadcrumbs"
  - id: A2
    given: "workspace with 1000+ files and multiple collaborators"
    when:  "user searches for 'holiday'"
    then:  "returns relevant results in < 200ms with proper faceted filtering"
  - id: A3
    given: "user with editor role in workspace"
    when:  "attempts to edit file with viewer-only permissions"
    then:  "access denied with clear error message and permission inheritance works correctly"
  - id: A4
    given: "large workspace with complex hierarchy"
    when:  "user performs bulk operations (move 50 files between projects)"
    then:  "operations complete successfully with proper metadata updates and audit logging"
  - id: A5
    given: "collaborative editing scenario with multiple users"
    when:  "users edit same file simultaneously"
    then:  "conflicts resolved automatically via operational transformation"
