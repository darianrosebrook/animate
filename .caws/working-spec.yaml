title: "Core scene graph and timeline system with deterministic evaluation"
risk_tier: 1  # Critical system component requiring highest quality standards
mode: feature
change_budget:
  max_files: 40  # Limit file changes to maintain focus
  max_loc: 1500  # Limit code additions for this feature
blast_radius:
  modules: ["core", "timeline", "scene-graph", "evaluator", "render"]  # Systems this will impact
  data_migration: true  # Requires database schema changes
operational_rollback_slo: "5m"  # Must be able to rollback within 5 minutes
threats:
  - "Non-deterministic rendering across different GPU vendors"  # Same scene should look identical everywhere
  - "Timeline performance degradation with complex nested compositions"  # Must maintain 60fps playback
  - "Memory leaks in scene graph node lifecycle"  # Must clean up resources properly
  - "Race conditions in real-time evaluation"  # Multi-threaded evaluation must be safe
scope:
  in: [
    "scene graph data structures",  # Tree structure for organizing visual elements
    "timeline evaluation engine",  # System for computing animation values over time
    "keyframe interpolation",  # Calculating smooth transitions between animation points
    "deterministic rendering pipeline",  # Ensures identical output across all platforms
    "node lifecycle management"  # Creating, updating, and destroying scene elements
  ]
  out: [
    "audio processing",  # Will be handled in separate feature
    "collaboration features",  # Requires CRDT implementation
    "plugin system",  # Extensibility layer for third-party effects
    "3D transforms",  # 3D support planned for later phase
    "advanced effects"  # Complex shaders and filters
  ]
invariants:
  - "Same input parameters always produce identical output frames"  # Deterministic rendering guarantee
  - "Scene graph maintains acyclic dependency structure"  # No circular references that could cause infinite loops
  - "Timeline evaluation respects temporal ordering"  # Earlier times evaluated before later times
  - "Memory usage scales linearly with scene complexity"  # Performance must not degrade exponentially
  - "All keyframes interpolate deterministically"  # Same easing curve always produces same result

  - id: A4  # Cross-platform consistency test
    given: "keyframe with bezier easing curves"
    when: "sampling at arbitrary time values"

  - id: A5  # Memory management test
    given: "scene with memory-intensive assets"
    when: "evaluating over time"
    then: "bounded memory usage with proper cleanup"
