title: "Implement real-time multi-player editing with CRDT-based collaboration system"
risk_tier: 1
mode: feature
change_budget:
  max_files: 40
  max_loc: 1500
blast_radius:
  modules: ["collaboration", "scene-graph", "timeline", "ui", "api"]
  data_migration: false
operational_rollback_slo: "30m"
threats:
  - "Real-time synchronization conflicts causing data loss"
  - "Performance degradation with multiple concurrent users"
  - "Network latency affecting collaboration responsiveness"
  - "Security vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer communication"
  - "CRDT implementation bugs causing inconsistent document state"
scope:
  in: ["real-time collaboration infrastructure", "CRDT document model", "presence system", "conflict resolution", "session management", "collaboration UI components"]
  out: ["offline collaboration", "advanced review workflows", "enterprise SSO integration", "mobile collaboration optimization"]
invariants:
  - "Collaboration system maintains deterministic document state across all participants"
  - "Real-time synchronization preserves user intent and prevents data loss"
  - "Presence system updates cursor positions within 100ms latency"
  - "Conflict resolution automatically merges non-conflicting changes"
  - "Session management maintains security and access control"
  - "Collaboration features do not degrade 60fps timeline performance"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "two users join the same collaboration session"
    when: "both users edit different properties of the same scene node simultaneously"
    then: "both changes are applied without conflicts; document state remains consistent"
  - id: A2
    given: "user moves cursor while another user is editing"
    when: "cursor position updates are broadcast to all participants"
    then: "cursor appears at correct position within 100ms; no performance impact on editing"
  - id: A3
    given: "user adds keyframe to timeline track"
    when: "another user is scrubbing the timeline"
    then: "keyframe appears immediately; timeline scrubbing remains smooth at 60fps"
  - id: A4
    given: "network connection is temporarily lost during collaboration"
    when: "connection is restored"
    then: "document state synchronizes correctly; no data loss or conflicts"
  - id: A5
    given: "collaboration session with 5+ concurrent users"
    when: "all users perform simultaneous edits"
    then: "system maintains <200ms property sync latency; no performance degradation"
