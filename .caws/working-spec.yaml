title: "Implement GPU-Accelerated Effects System with Real-time Performance"

  modules: ["effects", "renderer", "timeline", "gpu"]
  data_migration: false
operational_rollback_slo: "15m"
threats:
  - "GPU shader compilation could fail on different hardware"
  - "Effect performance regression could impact timeline playback"
  - "Memory leaks in GPU resources during effect composition"
scope:
  in: ["effect node architecture", "GPU shader framework", "core visual effects (glow, blur, color correction)", "timeline integration", "real-time preview"]
  out: ["advanced particle effects", "3D effects", "custom shader editor", "effect marketplace"]
invariants:
  - "Effects maintain deterministic output across all supported GPUs"
  - "Real-time effect preview updates within 16ms response time"
  - "Effect parameters preserve alpha channel and layer blending modes"
  - "Performance impact ≤5% on existing compositions with similar effects"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "composition with 50+ layers including text, shapes, and media"
    when: "apply glow effect with intensity=0.8, radius=20, color=#FF6B35"
    then: "glow renders correctly in real-time preview; exported ProRes matches preview within ΔE < 1.0"
  - id: A2
    given: "glow effect applied to layer with alpha transparency"
    when: "scrub timeline at 60fps"
    then: "smooth playback without frame drops; alpha compositing preserved"
  - id: A3
    given: "glow effect with extreme parameters (radius=100, intensity=2.0)"
    when: "render at 4K resolution"
    then: "graceful fallback to software rendering if GPU memory insufficient"
  - id: A4
    given: "multiple effects applied to same layer (glow + blur + color correction)"
    when: "adjust effect parameters in real-time"
    then: "all effects compose correctly; performance maintains 60fps"
