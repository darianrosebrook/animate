blast_radius:
  modules: ["media", "timeline", "effects", "renderer", "ui"]
  data_migration: false
operational_rollback_slo: "30m"
threats:
  - "Video decoding performance may vary across GPU architectures"
  - "Large media files may cause memory pressure during import"
  - "Audio/video synchronization may drift during long playback sessions"
  - "Codec compatibility may vary across browsers and platforms"
scope:
  in: ["media import system", "GPU video decoding", "image processing pipeline", "timeline media integration", "audio waveform analysis", "media format support", "performance optimization"]
  out: ["advanced color grading", "3D media support", "batch processing workflows", "network media streaming"]
invariants:
  - "Media playback maintains frame-accurate timing within 1ms tolerance"
  - "GPU memory usage optimized for multiple concurrent video streams"
  - "Media import and processing completes within performance budgets"
  - "Audio/video synchronization preserved throughout playback session"
  - "Media assets load and display consistently across supported formats"
acceptance:
  - id: M1
    given: "user imports a 4K ProRes video file (2GB)"
    when:  "user scrubs timeline at 60fps"
    then:  "video plays smoothly without frame drops; memory usage stays within 2GB budget"
  - id: M2
    given: "user imports multiple video clips with audio tracks"
    when:  "user plays composition with 4+ video layers"
    then:  "audio/video sync maintained; waveform display accurate; performance above 50fps"
  - id: M3
    given: "user applies color correction to video layer"
    when:  "user adjusts parameters in real-time"
    then:  "color changes apply immediately; GPU processing maintains 60fps"
  - id: M4
    given: "user works with media library containing 100+ video/image assets"
    when:  "user searches and previews media assets"
    then:  "search completes in <500ms; thumbnails load quickly; no memory leaks"
