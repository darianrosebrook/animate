acceptance:

    given: "user creates complex animations via code"
    when: "they preview the animation"
    then: "animation renders at 60fps without impacting main application performance"
  - id: A4
    given: "user saves code snippets"
    when: "they reopen developer mode"
    then: "saved snippets are available and executable"
