## Technical Specifications

### Effect System Architecture
```typescript
interface EffectNode {
  id: string;
  type: EffectType;
  parameters: EffectParameters;
  enabled: boolean;
  blendMode: BlendMode;
  mask?: MaskDefinition;
}

interface EffectType {
  name: string;
  category: 'blur' | 'color' | 'distortion' | 'generative';
  parameters: EffectParameterDefinition[];
  shader: WGSLShaderModule;
  passes: number;
}

interface EffectParameterDefinition {
  name: string;
  type: 'float' | 'int' | 'color' | 'point' | 'size';
  defaultValue: any;
  min?: number;
  max?: number;
  step?: number;
}
```

### Shader Framework
```wgsl
// Example glow effect shader
struct GlowParams {
  intensity: f32,
  radius: f32,
  color: vec4<f32>,
}

@group(0) @binding(0) var inputTexture: texture_2d<f32>;
@group(0) @binding(1) var outputTexture: texture_storage_2d<rgba8unorm, write>;
@group(1) @binding(0) var<uniform> params: GlowParams;

@compute @workgroup_size(8, 8)
fn main(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id: vec3<u32>) {
  // Gaussian blur implementation
  // Glow effect computation
}
```

### Effect Composition Pipeline
- **Multi-Pass Rendering**: Support for effects requiring multiple render passes
- **Layer Blending**: 16 standard blend modes (normal, multiply, screen, etc.)
- **Mask Support**: Alpha masks and shape-based masking
- **Effect Caching**: Render result caching for improved performance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Effect parameter validation and bounds checking
- Shader compilation and parameter binding
- Effect evaluation and caching logic
- Blend mode calculations and accuracy

### Integration Tests
- Effect composition with multiple layers
- Timeline integration and keyframe animation
- GPU memory management and cleanup
- Cross-GPU compatibility testing

### E2E Tests
- Complete effect workflow from creation to rendering
- Effect animation and timeline scrubbing
- Effect library management and presets
- Performance testing with complex effect stacks

### Visual Regression Tests
- Golden frame testing for effect accuracy

- Performance regression detection
- Memory usage monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **GPU Shader Complexity**: Complex effects may impact performance
  - **Mitigation**: Progressive shader complexity with fallback options

- **Effect Composition**: Multiple effects may cause visual artifacts
  - **Mitigation**: Defined composition order and blend mode standards

- **Memory Management**: Large effect libraries may cause memory pressure
