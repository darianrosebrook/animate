## Technical Specifications

### Effect System Architecture
```typescript
interface EffectNode {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: EffectType
  parameters: EffectParameters
  enabled: boolean
  blendMode: BlendMode
  opacity: number
  keyframes?: Keyframe[]
}

interface EffectPipeline {

}
```

### GPU Shader Framework
```wgsl
// Effect shader interface
struct EffectUniforms {
  time: f32,
  resolution: vec2<f32>,
  parameters: array<f32, 32>,
  inputTexture: texture_2d<f32>,
  outputTexture: texture_storage_2d<rgba8unorm, write>
}

// Glow effect implementation
@compute @workgroup_size(8, 8)
fn glow_effect(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id: vec3<u32>) {
  let coord = vec2<f32>(id.xy);
  let uv = coord / uniforms.resolution;

  // Sample input texture
  let color = textureSampleLevel(inputTexture, linearSampler, uv, 0);

  // Apply glow effect
  let glow = calculate_glow(color, uniforms.parameters);

  textureStore(outputTexture, coord, glow);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Effect parameter validation and bounds checking
- Shader compilation and GPU resource management
- Effect composition and blending calculations
- Performance regression detection

### Integration Tests
- Complete effect rendering pipeline

- Multi-effect composition scenarios
- Cross-GPU compatibility testing

### E2E Tests
- Effect application and parameter adjustment workflows
- Real-time preview performance under load
- Effect export quality validation
- Memory leak detection over extended usage

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **GPU Compatibility**: Effects may behave differently across GPU vendors
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing on multiple GPU architectures
- **Performance Regression**: Complex effects may impact timeline performance
  - **Mitigation**: Performance budgeting and adaptive quality
- **Memory Management**: Effect resources may leak during complex compositions
  - **Mitigation**: Resource pooling and automatic cleanup

### Timeline Risks
- **Effect Complexity**: Advanced effects may require more implementation time
  - **Mitigation**: Start with core effects and expand incrementally
- **Integration Complexity**: Effects need seamless timeline and rendering integration
  - **Mitigation**: Clear interfaces and incremental integration testing
