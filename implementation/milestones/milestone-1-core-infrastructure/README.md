# Milestone 1: Core Infrastructure

## Overview
Establish the foundational infrastructure for Animator development, including project setup, build systems, development environment, and core architectural decisions.

## Goals
- ✅ Functional development environment with hot-reload
- ✅ Automated testing and CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Core architectural decisions implemented
- ✅ Basic project structure and tooling in place

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1.1: Project Setup & Architecture
**Duration**: 1-2 days

**Tasks:**
1. **Language & Framework Selection**
   - Finalize Rust + TypeScript architecture
   - Set up WASM compilation pipeline
   - Configure cross-platform build targets

2. **Core Dependencies**
   - Set up Rust core with wgpu for GPU abstraction
   - Configure TypeScript build system with Vite/Webpack
   - Add essential development dependencies

3. **Project Structure**
   ```
   src/
   ├── core/          # Rust core engine
   │   ├── scene-graph/
   │   ├── renderer/
   │   └── evaluator/
   ├── ui/            # TypeScript/React UI
   │   ├── components/
   │   ├── canvas/
   │   └── timeline/
   └── types/         # Shared type definitions
   ```

### Phase 1.2: Development Environment
**Duration**: 1 day

**Tasks:**
1. **Build System**
   - Configure Rust WASM compilation
   - Set up TypeScript compilation with strict mode
   - Add development server with hot reload

2. **Tooling Setup**
   - ESLint + Prettier configuration
   - Rust formatting and clippy rules
   - Development scripts and npm commands

3. **Debugging Infrastructure**
   - Source maps for WASM debugging
   - Console logging and error handling
   - Development performance monitoring

### Phase 1.3: Testing Foundation
**Duration**: 1-2 days

**Tasks:**
1. **Testing Framework Setup**
   - Jest/Vitest for TypeScript tests
   - Rust testing framework configuration
   - Cross-language testing utilities

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Build artifact generation

3. **Code Quality Gates**
   - Type checking enforcement
   - Linting on commit
   - Basic test coverage requirements

### Phase 1.4: Core Architecture Implementation
**Duration**: 2-3 days

**Tasks:**
1. **Memory Management**
   - Implement efficient memory pools
   - Set up cross-language memory sharing
   - Add memory leak detection

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error types
   - Graceful error recovery
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Logging & Observability**
   - Structured logging system
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Debug information for troubleshooting

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Development server starts and hot-reloads work
- [ ] Rust WASM compilation succeeds
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- [ ] Basic tests run and pass

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Build time < 30 seconds for incremental changes
- [ ] Development server startup < 5 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage stable during development

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] All code passes linting
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] Basic test coverage > 80%
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Decisions
- **Language**: Rust core + TypeScript UI
- **Graphics**: WebGPU/WGSL with wgpu abstraction
- **Build System**: Cargo + npm with WASM compilation
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest for TS, built-in for Rust

### Dependencies
```toml
# Rust core
wgpu = "0.19"          # GPU abstraction
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"   # WASM bindings
serde = "1.0"          # Serialization
thiserror = "1.0"      # Error handling

# TypeScript UI
react = "18.2"
typescript = "5.0"
vite = "4.0"
vitest = "0.34"
```

### Development Tools
- **IDE Support**: VS Code with Rust Analyzer + TypeScript
- **Debugging**: Chrome DevTools + WASM debugging
- **Testing**: Jest with coverage reporting
- **Linting**: ESLint + Clippy + Prettier

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **WASM Performance**: GPU operations through WASM may have performance overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Profile early, optimize hot paths, consider native fallbacks

- **Cross-language Complexity**: Rust/TypeScript boundary management
  - **Mitigation**: Clear interfaces, comprehensive testing, memory management discipline

- **Build Complexity**: Multiple compilation targets and languages
  - **Mitigation**: Automated build scripts, clear documentation, incremental builds

### Timeline Risks
- **Architecture Decisions**: May need revision after initial implementation
  - **Mitigation**: Prototype key interfaces early, be prepared to iterate

## Next Milestone Dependencies
- Milestone 2 (Scene Graph) requires core infrastructure to be stable
- Basic rendering system needs build system and GPU abstraction in place
- Timeline system depends on core data structures and memory management

## Deliverables
- [ ] Functional development environment
- [ ] Automated build and test pipeline
- [ ] Core architectural patterns implemented
- [ ] Performance and quality monitoring in place
- [ ] Documentation for development workflow
