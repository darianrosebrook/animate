## Technical Specifications

### Timeline Data Model
```typescript
interface Timeline {
  duration: number;
  frameRate: number;
  tracks: TimelineTrack[];
  markers: TimelineMarker[];
}

interface TimelineTrack {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'property' | 'audio' | 'video';
  keyframes: Keyframe[];
  enabled: boolean;
  locked: boolean;
}

interface Keyframe {
  time: number;
  value: any;
  interpolation: InterpolationMode;
  easing?: BezierCurve;
}
```

### Curve System
```typescript
interface AnimationCurve {
  keyframes: Keyframe[];
  interpolation: InterpolationMode;
  evaluate(time: number): any;
}

enum InterpolationMode {
  Linear = 'linear',
  Bezier = 'bezier',
  Stepped = 'stepped',
  Smooth = 'smooth'
}
```

### Playback Engine
- **Frame Scheduler**: RequestAnimationFrame-based timing
- **Audio Sync**: Web Audio API integration for sample-accurate playback
- **Cache Management**: Smart caching of rendered frames during playback

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Keyframe interpolation calculations
- Curve evaluation algorithms
- Timeline data structure operations
- Time conversion utilities

### Integration Tests
- Complete timeline editing workflow
- Playback synchronization with rendering
- Multi-track animation coordination
- Undo/redo functionality

### E2E Tests
- Timeline interaction workflows
- Animation playback and scrubbing
- Curve editing and keyframe manipulation
- Performance under load

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Timeline interactions may be sluggish with complex animations
  - **Mitigation**: Virtual scrolling, efficient data structures, background processing

- **Timing Accuracy**: Frame timing may drift during playback
  - **Mitigation**: High-precision timing, audio clock synchronization, performance monitoring

- **UI Complexity**: Timeline UI may become unwieldy with many tracks
  - **Mitigation**: Hierarchical organization, filtering, search capabilities

### Timeline Risks
- **Integration Complexity**: Timeline needs to work seamlessly with scene graph and rendering
  - **Mitigation**: Clear interfaces, incremental integration, comprehensive testing

- **User Experience**: Timeline interface may be difficult to learn
  - **Mitigation**: Familiar design patterns, extensive user testing, progressive disclosure
