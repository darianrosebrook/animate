## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Export system supports all major professional formats
- [ ] Hardware-accelerated encoding provides 10x+ performance improvement
- [ ] Batch export supports multiple compositions simultaneously
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking with accurate time estimates
- [ ] Quality validation prevents export of sub-standard content

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Export encoding achieves >90% GPU utilization
- [ ] Memory usage scales linearly with export complexity
- [ ] Network-based render farm achieves linear scaling
- [ ] Export queue handles 100+ concurrent jobs
- [ ] Real-time preview maintains 30fps during export

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Exported video matches timeline preview within ΔE < 1.0
- [ ] Audio loudness complies with EBU R128 standards
- [ ] Color space accuracy maintained throughout export pipeline
- [ ] No visible artifacts in exported content

## Technical Specifications

### Export Pipeline Architecture
```typescript
interface ExportPipeline {
  jobs: ExportJob[]
  workers: ExportWorker[]
  hardwareAcceleration: HardwareAcceleration
  qualityValidator: QualityValidator
  progressTracker: ProgressTracker
}

interface ExportJob {
  id: string
  composition: Composition
  format: ExportFormat
  quality: ExportQuality
  destination: ExportDestination
  progress: ExportProgress
  status: ExportStatus
}
```

### Hardware Acceleration
```wgsl
// GPU-accelerated encoding shader
@compute @workgroup_size(16, 16)
fn encode_h264(@builtin(global_invocation_id) id: vec3<u32>) {
  // Hardware-accelerated H.264 encoding
  // Motion estimation and compensation
  // Entropy coding and bitstream generation
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Export format validation and configuration
- Hardware acceleration detection and initialization
- Quality validation algorithms
- Progress tracking accuracy

### Integration Tests
- Complete export pipeline with real compositions
- Multi-format export verification
- Render farm job distribution
- Quality validation against reference renders

### E2E Tests
- Export workflow from timeline to final file
- Batch export with multiple compositions
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Error handling and recovery

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Hardware Compatibility**: GPU encoding may not work on all systems
  - **Mitigation**: Software fallback with performance degradation warning
- **Memory Management**: Large exports may exceed system memory
  - **Mitigation**: Streaming export with chunked processing
- **Format Complexity**: Professional formats have complex requirements
  - **Mitigation**: Start with core formats, expand incrementally

### Timeline Risks
- **Codec Integration**: Hardware codec integration may require vendor-specific workarounds
  - **Mitigation**: Software codecs as fallback, hardware as optimization
- **Quality Validation**: Perceptual quality metrics may be computationally expensive
  - **Mitigation**: Progressive validation with early termination

## Next Milestone Dependencies
- Media pipeline provides source material for export
- Effects system ensures exported content matches timeline preview
- Collaboration system enables team-based export workflows
- Library management supports export preset sharing

## Deliverables
- [ ] Complete export system with hardware acceleration
- [ ] Professional format support (ProRes, DNxHD, H.264, H.265, AV1)
- [ ] Batch rendering and render farm capabilities
- [ ] Quality validation and compliance reporting
- [ ] Real-time export progress and preview
- [ ] Comprehensive export testing and validation
