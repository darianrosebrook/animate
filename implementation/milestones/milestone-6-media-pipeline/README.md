## Technical Specifications

### Media Pipeline Architecture
```typescript
interface MediaNode {
  id: string
  type: 'video' | 'image' | 'audio'
  source: MediaSource
  properties: MediaProperties
  playbackState: PlaybackState
  syncSettings: SyncSettings
}

interface MediaPipeline {
  nodes: MediaNode[]
  timeline: Timeline
  decoder: MediaDecoder
  renderer: MediaRenderer

}
```

### Video Decoding Pipeline
```typescript
interface VideoDecoder {
  initialize(config: DecoderConfig): Promise<void>
  decodeFrame(): Promise<VideoFrame>
  seekTo(time: number): Promise<void>
  getMetadata(): Promise<MediaMetadata>
  destroy(): Promise<void>
}

interface VideoFrame {
  timestamp: number
  duration: number
  format: VideoFrameFormat
  texture: GPUTexture
  dispose(): void
}
```

### Audio Processing
```typescript
interface AudioProcessor {
  loadAudio(url: string): Promise<AudioBuffer>
  generateWaveform(samples: number): Promise<Float32Array>
  synchronizeWithVideo(videoTime: number): Promise<AudioTime>
  applyEffects(effects: AudioEffect[]): Promise<AudioBuffer>
}
```

## Testing Strategy
