# Animator: A New Compositing Platform for Motion Designers

If "Animator" signals multiplayer-first creation, predictable performance at scale, and a thriving platform, then a comprehensive motion design system must be built around four pillars: **real-time collaboration**, **deterministic GPU compositing**, **composable motion primitives**, and an **open, inspectable ecosystem**. Below is a comprehensive technical specification covering implementation details, architecture decisions, and actionable requirements.

## Implementation Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- **Deterministic by design**: Identical inputs produce identical outputs across all platforms and devices
- **Composition over configuration**: Building complex behaviors from simple, reusable primitives
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiplayer editing as a first-class feature, not a bolt-on afterthought
- **Performance-first**: 60fps interactions as a fundamental requirement, not an optimization
- **Extensible architecture**: Plugin ecosystem designed for safety, performance, and maintainability

**Technical Foundation:**
- **Language strategy**: Rust core engine with type-safe boundaries to JavaScript/TypeScript UI layer
- **Graphics**: WebGPU/WGSL cross-platform rendering with software fallbacks for compatibility
- **Collaboration**: CRDT-based document model with operational transforms for conflict resolution
- **Storage**: Content-addressable storage for assets with structured document format (JSON with binary supplements)
- **State management**: Immutable data structures with structural sharing for efficient updates and undo

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Live multiplayer editing** with cursor presence and real-time synchronization
- **Deterministic rendering** that produces pixel-identical results across platforms
- **Composable motion system** with reusable components and design tokens
- **Open plugin architecture** with safe execution sandbox and versioning
- **Production-grade features** including review workflows, branching, and compliance trails
