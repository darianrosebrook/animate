## 🎯 Current Focus: Risk Tier 1 Implementation

### Primary Deliverables
The documentation covers the foundational **scene graph and timeline system**:

- **Scene Graph**: Declarative node-based composition with DAG structure
- **Timeline Engine**: Time-based evaluation with deterministic rendering
- **Keyframe System**: Advanced interpolation with bezier curves and easing
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: Topological dependency resolution and caching

### Quality Requirements (Tier 1)
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥90%
- **Mutation Score**: ≥70%
- **Contract Tests**: Mandatory provider/consumer verification
- **Integration Tests**: GPU-enabled container testing
- **Manual Review**: Required for core evaluation logic

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidance

### For Core Contributors
1. **Study Architecture**: Review `scene-graph.plan.md` for design patterns
2. **Understand Testing**: Follow `scene-graph.test-plan.md` for validation approach
3. **Plan Deployments**: Use `scene-graph.impact-map.md` for migration strategy
4. **Meet Standards**: Ensure compliance with `scene-graph.non-functional.md`

### For Feature Developers
1. **Create Working Spec**: Draft new YAML spec in `.caws/working-spec.yaml`
2. **Risk Assessment**: Determine appropriate tier (1-3) for your feature
3. **Follow Patterns**: Use established contracts and interfaces
4. **Test Rigorously**: Apply testing strategy from [testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md) based on risk tier

## 🔍 Key Technical Concepts

### Scene Graph Architecture *(Tree Structure)*
```
Node (unique identifier, type, position/scale/rotation, properties)
├── ShapeNode (geometric shapes like rectangles, circles)
├── CompositionNode (groups of nodes with blending effects)
├── EffectNode (filters and transformations like blur, color correction)
└── PropertyNode (animatable values with keyframes and curves)
```

### Timeline Evaluation *(Processing Pipeline)*
```
User Input → Timeline → Sort Dependencies → Evaluate Each Node → Cache Frame
    ↓           ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Time Scrub  Scene State  Topological Order   Property Animation   Render Ready
(what time?)  (all nodes)  (no circular deps)  (smooth transitions)   (GPU ready)
```

### Quality Gates *(Verification Steps)*
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code checking for errors and style consistency
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions with many random inputs to ensure correctness
- **Contract Testing**: Verifying APIs work correctly between different parts of the system
- **Integration Testing**: Testing complete workflows with real GPU acceleration
- **Mutation Testing**: Intentionally breaking code to ensure tests catch the errors
- **Performance Testing**: Ensuring smooth 60fps playback under various conditions
- **[Comprehensive Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)**: Complete testing, benchmarking, and bottleneck identification framework
