## 🎯 Current Focus: Risk Tier 1 Implementation

### Primary Deliverables
The documentation covers the foundational **scene graph and timeline system**:

- **Scene Graph**: Declarative node-based composition with DAG structure
- **Timeline Engine**: Time-based evaluation with deterministic rendering
- **Keyframe System**: Advanced interpolation with bezier curves and easing
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: Topological dependency resolution and caching

### Quality Requirements (Tier 1)
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥90%
- **Mutation Score**: ≥70%
- **Contract Tests**: Mandatory provider/consumer verification
- **Integration Tests**: GPU-enabled container testing
- **Manual Review**: Required for core evaluation logic

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidance

### For Core Contributors
1. **Study Architecture**: Review `scene-graph.plan.md` for design patterns
2. **Understand Testing**: Follow `scene-graph.test-plan.md` for validation approach
3. **Plan Deployments**: Use `scene-graph.impact-map.md` for migration strategy
4. **Meet Standards**: Ensure compliance with `scene-graph.non-functional.md`

### For Feature Developers
1. **Create Working Spec**: Draft new YAML spec in `.caws/working-spec.yaml`
2. **Risk Assessment**: Determine appropriate tier (1-3) for your feature
3. **Follow Patterns**: Use established contracts and interfaces
4. **Test Rigorously**: Apply appropriate testing based on risk tier

## 🔍 Key Technical Concepts

### Scene Graph Architecture *(Tree Structure)*
```
Node (unique identifier, type, position/scale/rotation, properties)
├── ShapeNode (geometric shapes like rectangles, circles)
├── CompositionNode (groups of nodes with blending effects)
├── EffectNode (filters and transformations like blur, color correction)
└── PropertyNode (animatable values with keyframes and curves)
```

### Timeline Evaluation *(Processing Pipeline)*
```
User Input → Timeline → Sort Dependencies → Evaluate Each Node → Cache Frame
    ↓           ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Time Scrub  Scene State  Topological Order   Property Animation   Render Ready
(what time?)  (all nodes)  (no circular deps)  (smooth transitions)   (GPU ready)
```

### Quality Gates *(Verification Steps)*
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code checking for errors and style consistency
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions with many random inputs to ensure correctness
- **Contract Testing**: Verifying APIs work correctly between different parts of the system
- **Integration Testing**: Testing complete workflows with real GPU acceleration
- **Mutation Testing**: Intentionally breaking code to ensure tests catch the errors
- **Performance Testing**: Ensuring smooth 60fps playback under various conditions

## 📖 Technical Glossary

| Term | Simple Explanation | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Scene Graph** | Tree structure organizing visual elements | Enables efficient rendering and animation |
| **DAG** | Directed Acyclic Graph (no circular dependencies) | Prevents infinite loops in evaluation |
| **Keyframe** | Point defining animation value at specific time | Foundation of smooth motion |
| **Interpolation** | Calculating values between keyframes | Creates smooth transitions |
| **Deterministic** | Same input always produces same output | Ensures consistent renders across machines |
| **Mutation Score** | Percentage of code bugs our tests can catch | Higher score = more reliable code |
| **CRDT** | Conflict-free Replicated Data Type | Enables real-time collaboration |
| **SBOM** | Software Bill of Materials | Tracks all dependencies and licenses |
| **SLSA** | Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts | Ensures software supply chain security |
| **WebGPU** | Modern graphics API for web browsers | Enables GPU acceleration everywhere |

## 📊 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Component | Risk Tier | Description | Code Coverage | Mutation Score | Manual Review |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Scene Graph Core** | **Tier 1** | Critical system foundation | 90%+ branches | 70%+ score | Required |
| **Timeline Engine** | **Tier 1** | Time-based evaluation | 90%+ branches | 70%+ score | Required |
| **GPU Rendering** | **Tier 2** | Performance-critical | 80%+ branches | 50%+ score | Optional |
| **UI Components** | **Tier 3** | User interface | 70%+ branches | 30%+ score | Optional |

### Risk Tiers Explained
- **Tier 1** (🔴 Critical): Core functionality that could break the entire application
- **Tier 2** (🟡 Important): Features that affect user experience but have fallbacks
- **Tier 3** (🟢 Quality): Enhancements that don't affect core functionality

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### CAWS Methodology
