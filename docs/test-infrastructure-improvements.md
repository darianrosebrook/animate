# Test Infrastructure Improvements Summary

## Overview

Significant improvements have been made to the Animator project's test infrastructure to address hanging test issues and improve reliability. The focus has been on simplifying complex mocks, adding better error handling, and creating reusable test utilities.

## 🔧 Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Test Runner Hanging Issues ✅

**Problem**: Tests were hanging indefinitely due to complex WebGPU mocks and circular dependencies.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Simplified WebGPU Mocks**: Removed complex nested objects and properties that were causing infinite recursion
- **Fixed Logger Circular Import**: Removed circular dependency in `logger.ts` that was causing infinite recursion
- **Added Global Timeouts**: Set 10-second timeout for all tests to prevent infinite hanging
- **Improved Mock Structure**: Used simpler, more predictable mock objects

### 2. Complex Mock Dependencies ✅

**Problem**: Overly complex WebGPU device mocks with hundreds of properties were causing performance issues and unpredictable behavior.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Mock Simplification**: Reduced WebGPU device mock from 50+ properties to essential 8 methods
- **Consistent Mock Structure**: Standardized mock objects across all test files
- **Removed Unnecessary Properties**: Eliminated complex nested objects and arrays

### 3. Error Handling Improvements ✅

**Problem**: Tests failing silently or with unclear error messages.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Global Error Handler**: Added unhandled promise rejection handler
- **Test Utilities**: Created reusable test helper functions
- **Better Mock Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup between tests

## 📋 Infrastructure Changes

### 1. Test Utilities (`src/test/test-utils.ts`)

**New utility functions added**:
```typescript
// Simplified WebGPU device creation
export function createMockGPUDevice()

// Simplified WebGPU context creation
export function createMockWebGPUContext()

// Mock timeline and effects system creators
export function createMockTimeline()
export function createMockEffectsSystem()

// Timeout wrapper for async operations
export function waitForPromise<T>(promise: Promise<T>, timeoutMs?: number)

// Test state reset utilities
export function resetAllMocks()
```

### 2. Enhanced Test Setup (`src/test/setup.ts`)

**Improvements made**:
- **Global Test Timeout**: 10-second timeout prevents infinite hanging
- **Simplified WebGPU Mock**: Basic navigator.gpu mock with essential functionality
- **Console Mocking**: Prevents test output pollution during testing
- **Error Handler**: Catches unhandled promise rejections
- **Proper Cleanup**: Resets all mocks between tests

### 3. Simplified WebGPU Mocks

**Before** (Complex, 50+ properties):
```typescript
const mockGPUDevice = {
  createBuffer: vi.fn(() => mockGPUBuffer),
  createTexture: vi.fn(() => mockGPUTexture),
  // ... 50+ more properties with complex nested objects
  limits: {
    maxTextureDimension1D: 8192,
    maxTextureDimension2D: 8192,
    // ... 20+ limit properties
  }
}
```

**After** (Simple, 8 essential methods):
```typescript
const mockGPUDevice = {
  createBuffer: vi.fn(() => ({ destroy: vi.fn() })),
  createTexture: vi.fn(() => ({
    createView: vi.fn(() => ({})),
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
    format: 'rgba8unorm',
    destroy: vi.fn(),
  })),
  createSampler: vi.fn(() => ({})),
  createShaderModule: vi.fn(() => ({})),
  createBindGroupLayout: vi.fn(() => ({})),
  createPipelineLayout: vi.fn(() => ({ bindGroupLayouts: [] })),
  createComputePipeline: vi.fn(() => ({ getBindGroupLayout: vi.fn(() => ({})) })),
  createCommandEncoder: vi.fn(() => ({
    beginComputePass: vi.fn(() => ({
      setPipeline: vi.fn(),
      setBindGroup: vi.fn(),
      dispatchWorkgroups: vi.fn(),
      end: vi.fn(),
    })),
    finish: vi.fn(() => ({})),
  })),
}
```
